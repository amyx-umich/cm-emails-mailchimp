                An exceptional educator and soft matter researcher, Sharon C. Glotzer, has taken the helm of the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Michigan. Glotzer’s academic stature and impact is reflected in her numerous, noteworthy distinctions. Says Glotzer about the future of the department:
            </p>
            <p class="inset" mc:edit="quote-01">
                “Most science and engineering disciplines haven’t yet incorporated data science into their curriculum, and this is true for chemical engineering. But companies I speak to are desperate to hire not data scientists to whom they must teach engineering, but rather chemical engineers who know data science. That is a huge opportunity for us because Michigan is a leader in data science, and several groups are already pioneering its use to solve chemical engineering problems. We have a major new institute for data sciences and another for scientific computing, putting us far ahead of our peers. We’re ready to work with our experts to develop what undergraduates, graduate students and employers are asking for – a curriculum that doesn’t yet exist for any chemical engineering department.”

                        is coming to the University of Michigan in September 2017 as the Albert M. Mattocks Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chemical Engineering. He received his PhD from the University of Delaware and was previously on the faculty at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. His research aims to develop next generation technologies for designing, discovering, engineering, characterizing, formulating and delivering biologics ranging from small affinity peptides to large monoclonal antibodies for molecular imaging, diagnostic and therapeutic applications. He has received several early-career honors including the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2010.

                        will join the department as an assistant professor in January 2018, after completing postdoctoral work at the University of Washington Clean Energy Institute and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. He also received his PhD from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2015. Professor Singh’s research focuses on improving electrochemical processes to effectively use renewable electricity. His main goal is to develop processes to store energy, produce useful products such as transportation fuels or industrially-needed chemicals, and clean up waste streams varying from agricultural to low-level nuclear waste.
